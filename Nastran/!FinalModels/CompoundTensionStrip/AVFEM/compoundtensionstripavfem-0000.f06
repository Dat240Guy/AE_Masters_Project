 *** USER WARNING MESSAGE 4500 (GPSP)
     STIFFNESS MATRIX PURGED, GRID POINT SINGULARITY NOT TESTED.
     User information:
     The stiffness matrix (KGG) input to module GPSP was purged.  No
     singularity testing was possible.  This can occur normally during
     checkout of downstream superelements before their upstream components
     are reduced.  Assemble and reduce the upstream superelements.

 *** SYSTEM WARNING MESSAGE 3001 (DCMP)
     THE INPUT DATA BLOCK NAMED KLL      AT POSITION      4 DOES NOT EXIST.
     USER INFORMATION: THIS ERROR IS CAUSED BY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
          1. THE DATA BLOCK WAS NEVER CREATED.
          2. THE DATA BLOCK WAS DELETED.
          3. THE DATA BLOCK IS SPECIFIED ON A TYPE STATEMENT IN THE CURRENT SUBDMAP OR A HIGHER SUBDMAP
             BUT THE CURRENT QUALIFIER VALUES DO NOT MATCH
             THE QUALIFIER VALUES OF THE DATA BLOCK(S) ON THE DATABASE.
     USER ACTION: 1. IF YOU ARE EXECUTING A SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE SUPPLIED SOLUTION SEQUENCE AND NOT USING THE
                     ALTER EXECUTIVE CONTROL STATEMENT, THEN CHECK FOR BULK DATA AND/OR CASE CONTROL INPUT
                     ERRORS. IF NO ERRORS CAN BE FOUND, THEN CONTACT SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
                  2. IF YOU ARE EXECUTING A DMAP PROGRAM NOT SUPPLIED BY SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE, THEN FOR DEBUGGING
                     PURPOSES INSERT STATEMENT DIAGON(20) BEFORE THE MODULE SHOWN ABOVE.
     PROGRAMMER INFORMATION: THE FIST NUMBER IS    104 AND SUBROUTINE IS DCMP6
     User information:
     This message should normally not occur for SIEMENS PLM SOFTWARE SOLs, but it has been
     observed when there is a mismatch between Case Control commands and
     Bulk Data entries. Examples of this are: a missing FREQi entry in modal
     frequency response analysis or a DLOAD entry in the Case Control that
     has no matching DLOAD, RLOADi, TLOADi, or ACSRCE entry in the Bulk Data.
     Verify that all Case Control entries have corresponding references in
     the Bulk Data.
